## tourism

Do you believe that the benefits of tourism outweigh the negative impacts?

Well, `overtourism` does lead to some problems, including environmental degradation, dangerous conditions, and the `pricing-out of locals`. For instance, `inhabitants` of many cities around the world, such as Barcelona and Paris, complain about the `rising prices` of `goods and services`. However, the benefits of tourism are significant. People from around the world are more `closely connected` and we can all `gain a better understanding of` each other while traveling. So I do believe that the benefits of tourism outweigh the `drawbacks`.

overtourism n. 过度拥挤、人满为患

environmental degradation 环境恶化

the pricing-out of locals 当地居民因价格上涨而无法负担生活费用或房租（从而被迫搬离）
