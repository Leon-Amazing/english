For instance, <code>inhabitants</code> of many cities around the world, such as Barcelona and Paris, complain about the <code>rising prices</code> of <code>goods and services</code>. However, the benefits of tourism are significant. People from around the world are more <code>closely connected</code> and we can all <code>gain a better understanding of</code> each other while traveling.
